# DevOpsBootcamp

Note: This project is a work in progress.

### Description

I get questions like this often "How do I get my first DevOps job?" or "How do I gain experience to get a DevOps job?".  I found myself giving people the same list of resources that I have used to over the years to learn more about DevOps and to grow my own career.

This project is a collection of my favorite resources I've used over the years to learn about DevOps are related topics.

The Table of Contents outlines what I think are the major buckets of knowledge used on a regular basis working in the field.

Caveat... if you are new to this type of work, I think this list below can be overwheming and potentially discouraging. That is not my intention here. Rather I hope it provides a outline of content to learn over the years to come.  There seems to be a trend to learn things quickly. Titles like "Learn Python in 10 mins" and "Learn Kuberentes in 3 hours" are common and alluring, but unrealistic. The reality is that if you want to be good, you should think on the timeline of years, not minutes or hours. This article ["Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig describes this beautifully.
