# DevOpsBootcamp

Note: This project is a work in progress.

### Description

I get the questions like this often "How do I get my first DevOps job?" or "How do I gain experience to get a DevOps job?".  I found myself giving people the same list of resources that I have used to over the years to learn more about DevOps and grow my own career.

This project is a collection of my favorite resources I've used over the years to learn about DevOps are related topics.

The Table of Contents outlines what I think are the major buckets of knowledge used on a regular basis working in the field.
