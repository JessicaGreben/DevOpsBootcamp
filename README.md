# DevOpsBootcamp

Note: This project is a work in progress and many of the topics below do not have resources added yet.

### Description

Its a common question: "How do I gain experience to get a DevOps job?".  I found myself giving people the same list of resources that I've used over the years to learn more about DevOps and to grow my career.

This project is a collection of my favorite resources I've used over the years to learn about DevOps and related topics.

The Table of Contents outlines what I think are the major buckets of knowledge used on a regular basis working in the field.

I've been slowly working my way through all the topics listed below. While there seems to be a trend to learn things quickly, gaining a skill should actually be on the timeline of years, not hours or days. This article ["Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig describes this beautifully.
