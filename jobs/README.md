#### Description

The topic of DevOps seems to elicit strong debate these days.  You will hear people argue "DevOps is not a job title! It's a culture/philosophy/value/etc."  And I'm not here to debate what DevOps is or isn't, more I want to discuss what type of jobs are out there that fall into this broad bucket of whatever "DevOps" is.

DevOps currently is a skill set in high demand.  There are lots of DevOps jobs available and the [pay tops the charts](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#work-salary-by-developer-type). Additionally the gender disparity is even more pronounced in DevOps related fields, the [2018 Stackoverflow survey displays](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-developer-role-and-gender) 25x relative paricipation by men vs women.

### What is a Site Reliability Engineer?

- Here is a great article by Dropbox SREs, [Interested in becoming a Site Reliability Engineer?](https://medium.com/@tammybutow/graduating-from-bootcamp-and-interested-in-becoming-a-site-reliability-engineer-b69a38ce858b).  While the content in the article seems really great, I also feel like it is an overwhelming amount of info. Try not to get scared away by the volume of info to learn. Just learn one thing a day, and a few years from all of this will seem less daunting.

- Here is a great book about [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html) at Google.
