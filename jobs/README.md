#### Description

The topic of DevOps seems to elicit strong debate these days.  You will hear people argue "DevOps is not a job title! It's a culture/philosophy/value/etc."  And I'm not here to debate what DevOps is or isn't, more I want to discuss what type of jobs are out there that fall into this broad bucket of whatever "DevOps" is.

DevOps currently is a skill set in high demand.  There are lots of DevOps jobs available and the [pay tops the charts](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#work-salary-by-developer-type). Additionally the gender disparity is even more pronounced in DevOps related fields, the [2018 Stackoverflow survey displays](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-developer-role-and-gender) 25x relative paricipation by men vs women.
