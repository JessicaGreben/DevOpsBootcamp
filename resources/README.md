- Here is a great article by Dropbox SREs, [Interested in becoming a Site Reliability Engineer?](https://medium.com/@tammybutow/graduating-from-bootcamp-and-interested-in-becoming-a-site-reliability-engineer-b69a38ce858b).  While the content in the article seems really great, I also feel like it is an overwhelming amount of info. Try not to get scared away by the volume of info to learn. Just learn one thing a day, and a few years from all of this will seem less daunting.

#### Web Development Bootcamp Resources

- This great option if you don't have the cash to attend a onsite dev bootcamp, [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) offers a free dev bootcamp online.  I compared the curriculum of Free Code Camp to the curriculum of the dev bootcamp I attended and its nearly identical, but $15k cheaper.  If you are a self starter, then this option could save you a bundle.
