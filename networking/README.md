#### TCP/IP

- Pluralsight [Course on Networking](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/networking-cisco-ccna-200-125-100-105/table-of-contents).  I love this course, really helped solidify TCP/IP fundamentals.

#### DNS

- Great O'reilly book, [BIND and DNS](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596100575.do)
