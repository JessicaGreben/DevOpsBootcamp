Books:

These are my current 2 favorite books:
- This first one is a unix/linux sys admin book. The authors are hilarious and make this a fun read. Both 4th and 5th editions are great, but for different reasons. The 5th edition is more modern covering topics like containers and the cloud, however I like the 4th edition because they have exercises at the end of the chapters that I think are helpful to solidify the material.

- This book goes in more detail and I would consider it more advanced. It has great exercises in the book. Highly recommend this book if you are interested in diving deeper into Linux.
